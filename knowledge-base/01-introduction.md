# Introduction to Creatomate Integration

Creatomate is a cloud-based media automation platform for developers and no-code users. It allows you to generate videos and images programmatically using templates and a powerful API.

## REST API vs Direct API

- **REST API**: Asynchronous, best for server-to-server communication. Use it to create renders, check status, and receive webhooks. [API Docs](https://creatomate.com/docs/api/introduction)
- **Direct API**: Synchronous, best for client-side rendering (e.g., in the browser). Pass all parameters in the URL and receive the result in the same request. [Direct API Docs](https://creatomate.com/docs/api/direct-api/introduction)

## Official Libraries and SDKs

- **Node.js**: [creatomate-node on GitHub](https://github.com/creatomate/creatomate-node)
- **PHP**: Available on Packagist
- **Preview SDK**: For interactive previews in the browser
